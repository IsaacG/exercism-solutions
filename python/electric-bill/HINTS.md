# Hints

Remember that you can always reuse/call previously completed functions when writing new ones.

## 1. Get extra hours

- This is all about calculating the _remainder_ left after whole division.
- Take a look at [`divmod()`][divmod], and look for an operator that does something similar.

## 2. Get kW value

- Remember to give [`round()`][round] a number of _decimal places_, or you will get a whole number back as a result.

## 3. Get kwh value

- The result of dividing an `int` by a `float` is always a `float`.
- To get only an integer value from division, use [_floor_ division][floor], which will truncate the decimal.

## 4. Get efficiency

- The result of dividing an `int` by a `float` is always a `float`.

## 5. Get cost

- It might be good to _reuse_ or call other functions you have already completed here.
- The result of dividing an `int` by a `float` is always a `float`.
